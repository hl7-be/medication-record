### Content

This publication contains the specifications related to the Medication Schema v2, the FHIR implementation of a patient's medication overview.
This is organised in diferent sections, which provide the necessary narrative background and functional overview, as well as the functional description and requirements, 
and the actual technical specifications for designers, implementers and testers.

**Background**: Information about the specifications, or what you should know to be able to best navigate and use these specifications. Contains a general introduction to the publication structure and content, the artefact types, common privacy and security specifications and the official HL7 FHIR release that this specification is based upon.
**Functional Description**: Functional content, more relevant for business or functional analysts, as well as health professionals. Contains the context around these specifications (relevant projects, legal and implementation aspects), the interoperability actors and transactions, and especially the use cases that have been considered in the specification and the logical data models - the functional (i.e. non-technical) data sets that are used in data exchange.

**Detailed Specifications**: The actual technical specifications - the FHIR conformance resources that are defined in this specification - profiles, data types, capability statements. This is targeted at (technical) implementers.
**Terminology**: The vocabulary resources - Naming Systems, Code Systems and Value Sets, which support semantic interoperability. These resources define the use of standard terminologies (e.g. LOINC, SNOMED-CT) or internal codes for Belgium, e.g. official codes for Civil Status).
