The Belgian Medication Scheme is modular, which enables the evolution towards a more detailed and comprehensive overview of a patient's medication, when adequate.  

It consists of MedicationScheme, which contains Medication Treatment Lines. Each line can trigger the creation of Prescriptions, or can be itself created because of existing prescriptions. In some cases, there is no Prescription (yet), and the Medication Treatment Line can be associated with a Dispense directly.
