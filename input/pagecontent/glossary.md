In this specification, the following terms and concepts are used:

| | |
|----|----|
|**Medication Record**| a collection of all past, future and current medication treatments for a patient. This may include the related data objects such as prescriptions, dispenses, etc. but does not necessarily incorporate adjacent information like allergies, lab results, etc.|
| | |
|**Medication Treatment**| a set of medications used in a given context - for example one disease, or one episode.|
| | |
|**Medication Treatment line**| One medication product that is used (or planned) for a patient, including the details on how the medication is or should be used (for example posology).<br/>A medication treatment line always is associated with a treatment, even if that treatment is not a prescription or even planned (for example self-reported OTC medication usage).<br/>The same medication (line) can be referred in more than one treatment.<br/>A Medication Treatment Item can trigger prescriptions, dispenses or medication administrations in order to fulfill the medication, or can be created and updated by those.|
| | |
|**Medication View**| A purpose-specific collection of medication lines (medication view lines) representing a distinct view on the data that is relevant for that purpose, for example a patient-friendly schedule view, or a physician's aggregated view,...<br/> This differs from the Medication Treatment in that the medication treatment is the "original" information - what is known at a given time to be the medication treatments of the patient - whereas the view can be transversal to several treatments, or detailed as needed.|
| | |
|**Medication View line**| one entry in the medication view, representing a purpose-specific perspective on one or several medication treatment lines - for example a single line in a patient's schedule for the week.<br/>Because the medication view line (and medication view) are purpose-specific, there may be different medication view lines for the same medication treatment line.<br/>*note that structure of the Medication View line is similar to that of the Medication Treatment line -but they are used differently - one to capture the original data, the other to represent the derived data*
| | |
|**Medication Prescription**| A request or authorization to start (or continue) a medication treatment for a patient. This includes the authorization and instructions for the supply of the medication, as well as any necessary authorization and instructions for the administration - whether for the patient or for professionals.
| | |
|**Medication Dispense**| A record of dispensing a medication - i.e. assigning (and handing over) a medication to a patient.|
|**Medication Administration**| A record of a single administration of medication - or combined administrations, depending on the granularity possible.
| | |
|**Medication statement**| A patient's statement of using or not using a medication.
| | |
|**Medication data collection**| The process and outcome of collecting data about a patient's medication. This collection can be in different forms and from different sources.
| | |
|**Medication data aggregation**| The process of combining and linking data about a patient's medication based on existing rules - for example resolving duplicates, linling .
| | |
|**Medication Reconciliation**| The process of creating and maintaining a single list of medications for a patient, for a specific purpose, and the necessary adjustments to the treatments / treatment lines that are deemed necessary (for example when finding duplicate medication lines).
| | |
|**Medication View Creation**| The process of creating a specific representation - for example in list format
