# Medication Classification and grouping

Classification and grouping are especially important when we have medication workflows. We need to be able to group medication from several points of view to facilitate visualization, clinical practice and medication usage.

The easiest and usual classifications are chemical and clinical classifications. Where the products and drugs are classified and grouped regarding intrinsic properties. However, there are more subjective classifications like legally or clinically controlled medication which can be substantially different from institution to institution.

Moreover, we may want to guarantee flexible grouping and classification since the summary view should be possible to make aggregation on-demand on several kinds of properties. This will enable easier visualization and better healthcare practices.

An example is stated below.
