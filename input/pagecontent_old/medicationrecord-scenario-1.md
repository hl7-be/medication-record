Scenario

This scenario shows the concurrent medication and the relevance in a medication overview that is independent of underlying indication, and can consider different pharmaceutical products.
This scenario also shows the value of medication terminologies, namely ATC. In this case, all the medications are different products, but they are all under ATC code A02BC.

* After a GP visit, the patient Pia Peters is prescribed a PPI (pantoprazole) for an ulcer.  

* A few days later, with his GP on vacation, the patient has an infection and the physician says the patient should take a PPI for protecting the stomach when taking antibiotics, and prescribes lanzoprazole.  

* When the GP is back, the daughter of Patient Pia Peters declares they have taken a PPI (omeprazole) for some time, when they have some gastric complaints.

This should result in a medication summary that can be grouped by the medication class, which allows a correct identification of concurrent medication.
