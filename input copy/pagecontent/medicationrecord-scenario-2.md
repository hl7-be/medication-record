Scenario

* Patient Paul Pauwels has hypertension and his physician prescribes him a predefined treatment.

The treatment protocol P5 consists of:  
First 4 weeks:  
- losartan, 50 mg, once a day  
- indapamide 1,5 mg once a day  
- amlodipine 5 mg once a day  
After 4 weeks:  
- if needed, increase losartan from 50 to 100 mg  
- maintain indapamide  
- maintain amlodipine  
<br/>
<br/>

The patient gets a  prescription for the 3 products.
After the pharmacy dispenses the medications, the patient starts the treatment.
After 4 weeks, the physician realizes that the patient's blood pressure justifies the increase of the dose for losartan, as per the protocol. The physician issues a new prescritpion but the patient still has the medication at home, so the physician tells the patient to simply start taking 2 tablets instead of one, until a few weeks later the patient goes to the pharmacy.
